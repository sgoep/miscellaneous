This respository is supposed to suite as a collection of useful functions and scripts that I wrote for solving inverse problems.

Note that the code depends heavliy on the implementation of the involved forward operators, signals, and so on. 

In the future, I plan to add more scripts and of course comment everything thoroughly.
